# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

The project involved analysis of the heart disease patient dataset with proper data processing. Then, different models were trained and and predictions are made with different algorithms KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest,SVM,Logistic Regression etc


We used a variety of Machine Learning algorithms, implemented in Python, to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. This is a classification problem, with input features as a variety of parameters, and the target variable as a binary variable, predicting whether heart disease is present or not.

Accuracy achieved: 95% (Random Forest)

Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci
